# Universal Assisted Generation: Enabling assisted generation with any assistant model

üèéÔ∏è <em>TL;DR</em>: Many models such as `Llama-3.1-8B` lack a smaller version to use for [assisted generation](https://huggingface.co/blog/assisted-generation). In this blog post we present a method developed by Intel Labs and Hugging Face for using a small model **from any other model family** to accelerate inference by **1.5x-2.0x**! üèéÔ∏è

The unprecedented success of LLMs has redefined the limits of NLP. However, a major challenge in their deployment is optimizing performance to reduce their response time.
Speculative decoding is a very popular and practical approach for accelerating LLMs achieving considerable speedups.

# Assisted Generation
 
The core concept of this method involves using a pair of models, referred to as the target and assistant models. The assistant model is a smaller, more efficient version of the target model, for example using `Llama-3.1-8b` as the assistant model for the larger `Llama-3.1-70b` target model.
Speculative decoding is an iterative process, during each cycle, the assistant model generates a sequence of tokens autoregressively, one at a time. The target model then verifies these assistant tokens in a single forward pass. The speedup is achieved by generating multiple tokens in each forward pass of the target model, rather than producing just one token at a time. For more detailed explanation see the original [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/assisted-generation).

The remarkable speedups offered by speculative decoding come with a significant drawback: the target and assistant models must share the same tokenizer, meaning they need to be from the same model family. However, many widely-used models lack smaller versions that are both compact and accurate enough to deliver substantial latency reductions. Based on our experience, meaningful speedups are typically seen when the size ratio between the target and assistant models is at least 50-100. For instance, `CodeLlama-13bB` lacks a smaller version, and `Gemma-2-9B` only has a 2B variant which is still not sufficiently small/fast to achieve significant performance improvements.

# Universal Assisted Generation
 
In order to mitigate this pain point, Intel Labs together with our friends in Hugging face developed Universal Assisted Generation (UAG). UAG enables selecting any pair of target and assistant models regardless of their tokenizer. For example, `gemma-2-9b` can be used as target model together with `vicuna-68m` as assistant model. The main idea behind this method is 2-way tokenizer translations. Once the assistant model completes a generation iteration, the assistant tokens are converted to text, which is then tokenized using the target model's tokenizer to generate target tokens. After the verification step, the target tokens are similarly converted back to the assistant tokens format, which are then appended to the assistant model's context before the next iteration begins.

Since the assistant and target tokenizers use different vocabularies it's necessary to handle the discrepancies between them. To accurately re-encode the newly generated assistant tokens, it‚Äôs essential to prepend a context window consisting of several previous tokens. This entire sequence is then re-encoded into the target token format and aligned with the most recent target tokens to pinpoint the exact location where the newly generated tokens should be appended. This process is illustrated in the video below.

While not shown in the video above, token re-encoding from target to draft follows a similar process. However, mismatched tokens must be discarded from the assistant model's key-value (KV) cache to ensure data integrity.


# Benchmarks

The table below shows the latency improvements observed for target models when paired with assistant models using different tokenizers:

| Target model | Assistant model | Dataset | Task | Speedup |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `codellama/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct-hf` | `bigcode/tiny_starcoder_py` | `openai/humaneval` | code generation | **1.90x** |
| `microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct` | `Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct`  | `tau/scrolls`   | long-context summarization | **1.91x** |
| `google/gemma-2-9b` | `double7/vicuna-68m`  | `cnn_dailymail`   | summarization | **1.76x** |

Note that the target models above do not have small variants which are suitable for acceleration usign standard assisted generation.

Experimental setup: 1 x A6000 GPU

## Code

Universal Assisted Generation currently is currently in the `main` version of ü§ó Transformers. Install using:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

To use, pass `tokenizer` and `assistant_tokenizer` to `generate()`:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> prompt = "Alice and Bob"
>>> checkpoint = "google/gemma-2-9b"
>>> assistant_checkpoint = "double7/vicuna-68m"

>>> assistant_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(assistant_checkpoint)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
>>> inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
>>> assistant_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(assistant_checkpoint)
>>> outputs = model.generate(**inputs, assistant_model=assistant_model, tokenizer=tokenizer, assistant_tokenizer=assistant_tokenizer)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)
['Alice and Bob are sitting in a bar. Alice is drinking a beer and Bob is drinking a']
```
